**Overview:**

This repository contains Terraform modules designed to facilitate the deployment of an application behind an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) within a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), alongside essential IAM roles and network configurations. Modularizing Terraform code not only enhances maintainability by organizing infrastructure components into reusable modules but also promotes scalability and clarity in infrastructure management.
